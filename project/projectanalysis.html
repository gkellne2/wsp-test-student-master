		<h5>Site Intent</h5>
		<p>In this Web Site redesign of Get Gaming Orlando the object is going to be 
		first to get all the validation cleared up by fixing the 11 errors that are 
		shown. I have found that when trying to navigate throughout the website there 
		are several pages that are not complete for example when entering Hello Friend
		page the page turns in to a blank field and is severing no purpose. Another
		major problem that is going to be redesigned is the Service Area & Hours page 
		once on that page I found that once you navigate to that page there is no easy 
		way to navigate back to the home page due to all the navigation links 
		disappearing.</p> 
		<p>The typographical boldness and the contrast of the font to the background makes
		the usability a little harder to read and not user friendly. The navigation is 
		overflowing the page as well as the header and footer. With the proper use of
		margin, padding and borders the site become more user friendly and easier on 
		the eyes.</p>
		
		<h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
		<p>When trying to find the Get Gaming Orlando on the web the address comes up 
		with ease. But when inserting it into the Alexa.com there are no reviews on the 
		company. This tells me that the page is not being used on line as much as it 
		should. Which understanding due to this is just a local company but in order to 
		make Get Gaming Orlando to get more people viewing the website its going to need 
		to be more user friendly.</p>
		<p>In the Alexa.com the reputation of Getgamingorlando.com is number 6 in the 
		last 3 months. The global traffic to the website is 20,750,813. There is a 69% 
		web search when searching for get gaming online. So this means that in order to 
		get the percentage up we are going to need the website to be more user friendly 
		which will draw more people to it and allow them to remember a good interaction 
		then a bad one.</p>
		<p>When I researched game repair in Orlando FL where Get Gaming Orlando is 
		located. I have found several major companies that will compete with this local 
		company and I have found that there sites allow online repairs which would not 
		only allow local repairs but out of state as well.</p>
		
		<h6>Targeted Audience</h6>
		<p>In a paragraph, or two, describe the targeted user group(s) and what you would 
		expect their potential needs/workflow would be. When looking at the potential 
		users of the website the first thing we have to look at who is going to be using 
		the website the most and why. Even know the website has gaming on it I would 
		think that because it is a gaming system and is mostly used for children and 
		teens but when the systems break or go bad there parent would be trying to fix 
		the system.</p> 

		<p>With that being said I would have to put the age between 18-45 and I would 
		think that it would be leaning towards males due to the fact that more males uses 
		video games then females.
